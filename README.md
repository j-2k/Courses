# All Courses notes
My personal notes about some courses & plan to do some things in the future to prepare for my master's in case I decide to pursue one in the near future.

### Specialization is to be of the ones below ONLY.
- Electrical Engineering
- Mathematics
- Computer Engineering or Science

After some research the favourability is as follows:
- EE == MM > CE >= CS
